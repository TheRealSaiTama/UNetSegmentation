## 🏗️ Model Architecture: The U-Net

The U-Net architecture is famous for its effectiveness in biomedical image segmentation. It consists of:

1.  **Contracting Path (Encoder):** Captures context through convolutional and max-pooling layers.
2.  **Expanding Path (Decoder):** Enables precise localization using transposed convolutions.
3.  **Skip Connections:** Merge high-resolution features from the encoder with the decoder path, crucial for detail preservation.

## 🛠️ Installation

Get up and running in a few steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/TheRealSaiTama/UNetSegmentation.git
    cd UNetSegmentation
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

## 💾 Dataset

This model expects medical images and their corresponding segmentation masks.

*   **Source:** Where can users get the dataset? (e.g., BraTS, LiTS, or your custom dataset link). Add links!
*   **Format:** What format should the images and masks be in? (e.g., NIfTI, DICOM, PNG).
*   **Structure:** How should the data be organized in the directory?
    ```
    data/
    ├── train/
    │   ├── images/
    │   │   ├── image_001.png
    │   │   └── ...
    │   └── masks/
    │       ├── mask_001.png
    │       └── ...
    ├── validation/
    │   ├── images/
    │   └── masks/
    └── test/
        ├── images/
        └── masks/
    ```
    *(Adjust the structure above to match your `DataLoader`)*

## ⚙️ Usage

<details>
<summary>🧠 Training the Model</summary>

To train the U-Net model on your dataset:

```bash
python train.py --data_path /path/to/your/data --epochs 50 --batch_size 4 --learning_rate 1e-4
```

**Configuration:**

*   `--data_path`: Path to the root directory of your dataset.
*   `--epochs`: Number of training epochs.
*   `--batch_size`: Training batch size.
*   `--learning_rate`: Initial learning rate.
*   *(Add any other important training arguments here)*

Checkpoints and logs will be saved in the `outputs/` directory (or specify location).
</details>

<details>
<summary>🔬 Performing Inference (Segmentation)</summary>

To use a trained model to segment new images:

```bash
python inference.py --model_path /path/to/your/trained_model.pth --input_dir /path/to/input/images --output_dir /path/to/save/masks
```

**Arguments:**

*   `--model_path`: Path to the trained model checkpoint (`.pth`, `.h5`, etc.).
*   `--input_dir`: Directory containing the images you want to segment.
*   `--output_dir`: Directory where the predicted segmentation masks will be saved.
*   *(Add any other relevant inference arguments)*
</details>
